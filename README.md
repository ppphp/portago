# portago

This is a package management tool written in go and copied from portage shamelessly.

Package Management by go can remove annoying python dependency, though it is meaningless in gentoo with additional stupid go dependency.

Honestly, the main problem is give the package manager a static type.

now portage portage-3.0.11
